We have experience of working with real estate companies from all over the world. We have developed advanced applications for automated valuation models, but we also develop applications for better property management or support the sales and rental process.

We believe that the combination of real estate with technology - PropTech, is a branch that opens up completely new business opportunities for our partners from around the world."/>
